    a parent area. These Elements will create a new line. 
        - EX. Setting up a sentence where the entire line is highlighted
        - Web EX. Div Element, <div> </div>, will create a new line and 
        add the attribute to the entirety of the webpage line

    Inline Elements- Elements/Attributes that will update only a portion
    of a block section content. The <span> tag help to add in Inline elements.
    This element will remian within the same line that the element is added into
